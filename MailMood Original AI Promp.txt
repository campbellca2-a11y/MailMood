MailMood - Product Context Brief
Overview
MailMood is a browser extension (initially Chrome/Firefox) that provides emotional intelligence for email communication. It analyzes both incoming and outgoing emails to show emotional tone/mood, helping users reduce email anxiety and prevent communication mistakes.
Core Problem Being Solved

Email anxiety - People dread opening emails because they don't know if the content will be angry, urgent, or stressful
Tone blindness - People send emails without realizing they sound hostile, pushy, defensive, or overly apologetic
Relationship damage - Poorly-worded emails damage professional and personal relationships
Information overload - Can't effectively triage 50+ unread emails by subject line alone

Two-Sided Value Proposition
Incoming Emails (Receive Mode)
Feature: Color-coded mood indicators appear next to emails in inbox view
What user sees:
📧 Subject: "Quick question about the report"
   🟢 Calm, professional

📧 Subject: "We need to talk"  
   🔴 Urgent, tense

📧 Subject: "Thank you so much!"
   🟡 Grateful, warm
Value: Users can see emotional temperature before opening, enabling better triage and mental preparation
Outgoing Emails (Compose Mode)
Feature: Real-time emotional tone analysis while composing emails
What user sees:
[User's draft email displayed]

Value: Prevents sending emails user will regret, improves professional communication quality
Technical Architecture
Core Technology: MightyTags™
Proprietary emotional parsing engine that:

Distinguishes emotional language from symptom language
Identifies specific emotional tags (frustration, gratitude, urgency, defensiveness, etc.)
Assigns intensity levels (low/medium/high)
Categorizes overall tone (Professional, Hostile, Warm, Defensive, etc.)

How It Works:
For Incoming Emails:

Extension scans email preview text in inbox view
Sends preview text to MightyTags API (over internet)
API analyzes and returns emotional tags
Extension displays color-coded indicator next to subject line

For Compose Mode:

User types email in Gmail compose window
Extension sends draft text to MightyTags API as user types (real-time)
API analyzes emotional tone in memory (doesn't store content)
Returns emotional breakdown
Extension displays tone panel with suggestions
Updates in real-time as user edits

Privacy Architecture:

Email content analyzed in real-time (in RAM/memory)
No permanent storage of email content
Process and forget model (like ephemeral analysis)
User trust built on "we never store your emails"
Optional local-only analysis mode for sensitive emails

Color-Coding System
🟢 Green = Calm, neutral, professional, matter-of-fact
🟡 Yellow = Warm, positive, grateful, encouraging
🔴 Red = Urgent, tense, frustrated, angry, demanding
🟣 Purple = Overly apologetic, lacking confidence, anxious
⚪ Gray = Automated, transactional, unclear emotional tone
🔵 Blue (optional) = Sad, disappointed, concerned

Crystal: Shows recipient's communication preferences - doesn't analyze YOUR tone
Boomerang Respondable: Predicts response likelihood - limited emotional analysis
MailMood: Only tool that shows emotional temperature of BOTH incoming and outgoing emails
