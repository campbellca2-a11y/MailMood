  <h1>MailMood Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Short version:</strong> MailMood never collects, stores, or transmits your email content.
    All analysis happens locally inside your browser and is discarded immediately.
  </div>

  <h2>What MailMood does</h2>
  <p>
    MailMood is a Chrome extension that detects the emotional tone of emails using
    deterministic keyword analysis. It displays tone badges in your Gmail inbox and
    offers a tone panel when composing email. No machine learning, no external AI
    services, and no remote servers are involved.
  </p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Nothing.</strong> MailMood does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data of any kind.</p>

  <h2>How email text is processed</h2>
  <p>
    When MailMood analyzes an email subject, preview, or compose draft, that text is
    processed entirely within your browser using logic bundled inside the extension itself.
    The text is never sent to any server, never written to disk, and is discarded
    immediately after analysis. There is no backend, no database, and no logging.
  </p>

  <h2>What is stored</h2>
  <p>Nothing related to your email is stored. MailMood uses Chrome's sync storage for one purpose only: remembering whether you have dismissed the welcome message. No email content, metadata, or personal information is ever written to storage.</p>

  <h2>Third parties</h2>
  <p>
    MailMood does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, tracking
    scripts, or AI services. No data is shared with any third party under any circumstances.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> — to save extension preferences locally in your browser</li>
    <li><strong>Access to mail.google.com</strong> — required to read email subjects and inject
    tone badges into the Gmail interface</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No other permissions are requested or used.</p>

  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>MailMood is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes materially, the extension version number will be updated
    and this page will reflect the new date.
