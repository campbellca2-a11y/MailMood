Check that:

Dots still feel secondary.

Envelope remains primary.

4️⃣ 128×128 (Store Listing)

This is where most icons go wrong.

Do NOT simply scale 8×.

Instead:

Stroke: ~10px (slightly lighter proportionally)

Dot diameter: increase by ~8–10% relative to pure scale

Slightly increase spacing for air

Maintain strict vertical alignment

Why?

At larger sizes:

Thin elements feel too delicate.

Dots can feel lost.

You rebalance visually — not mathematically.
